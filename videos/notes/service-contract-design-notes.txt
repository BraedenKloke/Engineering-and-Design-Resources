RESOURCE: YouTube - "Service Contract Design" w/ Juval Lowy

- Good design has the POTENTIAL for reuse (this doesn't mean you HAVE to reuse)
- We intuitively judge reusable things as being designed well
- NOTE: Services should have the potential for reuse, events should have the pot
ential for reuse
- EXAMPLE: Look at folder names ... names like Documents, Videos and Application
s are reusable as opposed to names like NovemberMeetingNotes or UdemyProjects. P
OTENTIALLY reusable folders are a better design than very specific or very broad
 folders. 
- REUSABLE = INDEPENDENT + COHERENT 
- NOTE: Maybe this is also true for learning ... it is not good to study just on
e resource just as it is not good to study a thousand ... a handful of resources
 is probably best ... a handful of specialties 
- Average 2-3 contracts per service
- Have the courage to take your time with the design - do not rush, no one will
understand
